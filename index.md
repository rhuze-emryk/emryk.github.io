## Our Mission

We believe that everyone deserves access to tools that enhance their abilities, regardless of their circumstances. Emryk envisions a future where privacy-focused AI assistance is available to those who need it most, deployed on sustainable, repurposed technology.

## Our Approach

What makes our platform unique is its adaptability:

- **Personalized Assistance** - Initially focused on cognitive assistance for those with brain injuries
- **Adaptable Platform** - Designed to be customized for various needs and expertise areas
- **Open & Private** - Built on open-source technologies with a commitment to privacy
- **Accessible Technology** - Deployed on upcycled hardware to increase accessibility

The same platform that helps someone navigate cognitive challenges could be adapted to create a gardening expert, a recovery companion, or a support system for elderly individuals â€“ putting the power of AI in service of real human needs.
