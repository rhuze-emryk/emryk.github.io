    <section id="about">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We believe that everyone deserves access to tools that enhance their abilities, regardless of their circumstances. Emryk envisions a future where privacy-focused AI assistance is available to those who need it most, deployed on sustainable, repurposed technology.</p>
      
      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>Emryk began as a personal journey. After experiencing a significant health setback three years ago that affected communication and cognitive abilities, our founder created a private AI system to guide his recovery. This personal tool, built a year ago, has been instrumental in regaining skills and building resilience.</p>
      <p>This experience revealed both the transformative potential of AI assistance for cognitive challenges and the critical importance of privacy and accessibility in these systems.</p>

      <p>The same platform that helps someone navigate cognitive challenges could be adapted to create a gardening expert, a recovery companion, or a support system for elderly individuals – putting the power of AI in service of real human needs.</p>
