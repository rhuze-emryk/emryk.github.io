# Welcome to Emryk

Emryk was born from a personal journey of recovery and healing. After experiencing a significant health setback that affected communication and cognitive abilities, our founder created a private AI system to guide his recovery process.

## Why Emryk Exists

We believe that AI technology should be:

1. **Accessible** - Available to those who need it most, regardless of circumstances
2. **Private** - Your data should remain yours
3. **Adaptive** - Able to grow and change with your needs
4. **Sustainable** - Built on repurposed hardware to reduce environmental impact

## What We're Building

Our initial focus is on cognitive assistance platforms for individuals with brain injuries or cognitive challenges. These systems are designed to:

- Provide personalized support for daily tasks
- Adapt to individual learning patterns and needs
- Run locally, without sending sensitive data to the cloud
- Function on affordable, repurposed hardware

## Join Us

We're in the early stages of this journey, and we welcome collaboration, feedback, and support. If you're interested in our mission or have ideas to share, please [reach out](mailto:info@emryk.com).
