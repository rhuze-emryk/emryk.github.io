# Why CogniTune Exists

Three years ago, brain aneurysms changed how I think, remember, and navigate the world. Traditional productivity tools weren't built for brains that experience fatigue, memory gaps, or executive dysfunction. So I built something different.

**CogniTune** isn't another tech solution trying to be everything to everyone. It's a Cognitive Amplifier - the hearing aid for the mind - designed specifically for brain injury survivors and neurodiverse individuals.

## What Makes CogniTune Different

### 1. Cognitive Amplification, Not Replacement
CogniTune learns your cognitive patterns:
- When you're most alert and when you need breaks
- How complex tasks need to be broken down for your brain
- Your unique triggers for cognitive fatigue

Just like a hearing aid amplifies sound in the way that's right for you, CogniTune amplifies your cognitive abilities in ways that match your brain's patterns.

### 2. Built by a Survivor
Every feature comes from lived experience:
- Understanding the frustration of lost words
- Knowing how overwhelm feels in your body
- Designing for the reality of non-linear healing

### 3. Privacy as a Foundation
Your cognitive data is deeply personal:
- Everything runs locally on your device
- Open-source code you can inspect and modify
- No corporate surveillance of your brain patterns

## Beyond Technology: NeuroFlowLabs

CogniTune is just the beginning. We're planning **NeuroFlowLabs** - physical spaces where cognitive amplification meets holistic healing:

- Sound baths that synchronize with cognitive training
- Music therapy integrated with our Cognitive Amplifier
- Community gatherings for peer support
- Integration with therapy and rehabilitation programs

## The Journey So Far

We've successfully completed our proof of concept and secured angel funding to bring CogniTune to those who need it most. Now we're building our team and forming partnerships to expand our reach.

**This is personal technology for a deeply personal journey.**
