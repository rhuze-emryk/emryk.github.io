# Our Approach

What makes our platform unique is its adaptability:

## Personalized Assistance

Initially focused on cognitive assistance for those with brain injuries, our AI systems are designed to adapt to individual needs, learning patterns, and preferences.

## Adaptable Platform

Designed to be customized for various needs and expertise areas, creating a versatile solution for diverse challenges.

## Open & Private

Built on open-source technologies with a commitment to privacy, ensuring your data remains yours alone.

## Accessible Technology

Deployed on upcycled hardware to increase accessibility and sustainability, bringing AI to those who need it most.

The same platform that helps someone navigate cognitive challenges could be adapted to create a gardening expert, a recovery companion, or a support system for elderly individuals â€“ putting the power of AI in service of real human needs.
