# Our Mission

To empower brain injury survivors and neurodiverse individuals with adaptive technology and holistic healing spaces that restore cognitive independence and rebuild lives.

## Our Story

Emryk began as a deeply personal journey. After experiencing brain aneurysms that affected communication and cognitive abilities, our founder created BrainAmp™ - a Cognitive Amplifier to guide his recovery. This adaptive technology, carefully tuned from lived experience, has been instrumental in regaining skills and building resilience.

This journey revealed both the transformative potential of cognitive amplification for brain injury survivors and neurodiverse individuals, and the critical need for privacy-focused, adaptive tools in this space.

## Vision: BrainAmp™ + BrainAmpCamps™

We're building more than just technology - we're creating an ecosystem where cognitive amplification meets holistic wellness.

**BrainAmp™** - Our open-source Cognitive Amplifier that:
- Tunes to individual brain patterns and cognitive rhythms
- Provides personalized self-care prompts (reminders to rest, hydrate)
- Learns and adapts to each user's unique needs and challenges
- *The hearing aid for the mind*

**BrainAmpCamps™** - Healing spaces where technology and wellness converge:
- Sound baths integrated with cognitive training
- Community events for brain injury survivors and neurodiverse individuals
- Therapy integration and peer support networks

## Current Status

We're in the early stages of bringing BrainAmp™ to life:

- **Proof of Concept Complete**: Successfully validated core technology and approach
- **Angel Funding Secured**: Initial investment received to develop and expand the platform
- **Team Building**: Currently hiring developers and forming strategic partnerships
- **Community Outreach**: Beginning to connect with potential users and neurorehabilitation centers

## Looking Forward

- **Phase 2 (2025)**: BrainAmpCamps™ pop-ups in Santa Monica, expanding BrainAmp™ features
- **Phase 3 (2026+)**: Permanent BrainAmpCamps™ space, community-driven cognitive amplification

Unlocking potential since 2025.
