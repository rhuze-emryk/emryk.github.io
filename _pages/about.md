# Our Mission

To empower brain injury survivors and neurodiverse individuals with adaptive technology and holistic healing spaces that restore cognitive independence and rebuild lives.

## Our Story

Emryk began as a deeply personal journey. After experiencing brain aneurysms that affected communication and cognitive abilities, our founder created CogniTune - a Cognitive Amplifier to guide his recovery. This adaptive technology, carefully tuned from lived experience, has been instrumental in regaining skills and building resilience.

This journey revealed both the transformative potential of cognitive amplification for brain injury survivors and neurodiverse individuals, and the critical need for privacy-focused, adaptive tools in this space.

## Vision: CogniTune + NeuroFlowLabs

We're building more than just technology - we're creating an ecosystem where cognitive amplification meets holistic wellness.

**CogniTune** - Our open-source Cognitive Amplifier that:
- Tunes to individual brain patterns and cognitive rhythms
- Provides personalized self-care prompts (reminders to rest, hydrate)
- Learns and adapts to each user's unique needs and challenges
- *The hearing aid for the mind*

**NeuroFlowLabs** - Healing spaces where technology and wellness converge:
- Sound baths integrated with cognitive training
- Community events for brain injury survivors and neurodiverse individuals
- Therapy integration and peer support networks
- Artist-in-Residence program with performance space

## Current Status

We're in the early stages of bringing CogniTune to life:

- **Proof of Concept Complete**: Successfully validated core technology and approach
- **Angel Funding Secured**: Initial investment received to develop and expand the platform
- **Team Building**: First hire completed. Searching for a finance co-founder. Forming strategic partnerships
- **Community Outreach**: Beginning to connect with potential users and neurorehabilitation centers

## Looking Forward

- **Phase 2 (2025)**: NeuroFlowLabs pop-ups in Santa Monica, expanding CogniTune features
- **Phase 3 (2026+)**: Permanent NeuroFlowLabs space, community-driven cognitive amplification

Your cognitive journey matters. Let's rebuild together.
