# Our Mission

We believe that everyone deserves access to tools that enhance their abilities, regardless of their circumstances. Emryk envisions a future where privacy-focused AI assistance is available to those who need it most, deployed on sustainable, repurposed technology.

## Our Story

Emryk began as a personal journey. After experiencing a significant health setback three years ago that affected communication and cognitive abilities, our founder created a private AI system to guide his recovery. This personal tool, built a year ago, has been instrumental in regaining skills and building resilience.

This experience revealed both the transformative potential of AI assistance for cognitive challenges and the critical importance of privacy and accessibility in these systems.

## Current Status

Emryk is in its early stages as a one-person operation. We're currently:

- Refining our core AI assistance platform
- Seeking initial funding to establish as a non-profit organization
- Building connections with potential community partners
- Planning for small-scale pilot deployments
